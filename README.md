# Wall is You! 
This game is about defeating dragons by strategically moving and rotating blocks. Below you will find instructions on how to play the game and navigate through its features. This game was made in 2 weeks as a final projet for the second semester of Python at my University.


## Game Objective
The objective of the game is to defeat all the dragons. The player automatically moves towards the dragon with the highest level. It is important to strategize your moves because if a dragon has a higher level than the player, the player will die.

To aid in your quest, diamonds can be collected and used to teleport the player to a specific position on the board. Use them wisely to gain an advantage and defeat the dragons.
